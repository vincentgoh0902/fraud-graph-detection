# Decision log

One entry per non-obvious choice: what we decided and why, so every decision can
be defended. Entries are never deleted; a reversed decision gets a new entry.

## D-001: Neighbour risk uses out-of-fold predictions, not training labels
**Context.** Elliptic edges only connect transactions within the same time step,
so train-period and test-period graphs are disjoint. A test node's neighbours are
all test nodes, whose labels are unknown at prediction time.
**Problem.** "Neighbour illicit-rate from training labels" is informative in
training but always 0 or missing at test. The model learns to depend on a signal
that disappears at test time: a train/serve skew, a form of leakage.
**Decision.** Two-stage stacking. Stage 1: a tabular XGBoost model produces
predicted risk for every node (including unknowns), using GroupKFold grouped by
time step on steps 1–34. Because graphs are disjoint per step, a node and its whole
neighbourhood fall in the same fold, so every training node's neighbour-risk is
truly out-of-fold. For test nodes, stage 1 is trained on all of 1–34. Stage 2
uses mean/max neighbour predicted risk as features.
**Why this is valid.** The feature is computed the same way at train and test
time, from information that exists at prediction time.
**Known limitation.** Out-of-fold models see slightly less data than the full
stage-1 model, so the feature's distribution may differ a little between train
and test. We'll check this by comparing the distributions.
**Verification.** A test asserts no node's neighbour-risk was computed by a model
that trained on that node's time step. EDA compares feature distributions.

## D-002: Louvain community properties, not community IDs
**Problem.** Louvain IDs are arbitrary integers with no meaning across runs or
time steps. As a feature they're meaningless numbers that tree models will still
split on.
**Decision.** Use community-level properties: size, internal edge density, and
mean stage-1 predicted risk of members (computed as in D-001).
**Verification.** No raw ID column appears in any feature matrix (feature-builder test).

## D-003: Feature set (c) is compared against (b), not only (a)
**Context.** The 72 "aggregated" Elliptic features are already one-hop
neighbourhood statistics, so (a) vs (b) is already a graph-information test.
**Decision.** Report three comparisons: (a)→(b) (value of the provided neighbourhood
aggregates), (a)→(c) (value of our graph features in place of them), and
(b)→(b+graph) (value added on top). Graph features only "help" if they beat (b).
**Why.** Otherwise we'd credit Neo4j with information the dataset already provides.

## D-004: Precision@K uses K chosen from the data, plus recall@K
**Problem.** Some test steps have fewer illicit transactions than 100, so
precision@100 has a low maximum and is misleading.
**Decision.** After EDA (Phase 1), pick K from the per-step illicit counts in the
*training* period (likely 20 or 50), fixed before any test evaluation. Report
recall@K and the per-step illicit count alongside it, so the reader sees the maximum
possible score.

## D-005: Validation uncertainty is reported
**Problem.** Steps 30–34 contain relatively few illicit examples, so a threshold
tuned there is noisy.
**Decision.** Bootstrap validation nodes to get a confidence interval for the tuned
threshold and validation F1. Report it next to test results.

## D-006: Seeds only for stochastic models
Logistic regression (lbfgs) is deterministic, so it runs once and reports no std.
RF, XGBoost and the GNNs run with ≥3 seeds and report mean ± std.

## D-007: Elliptic only; no second dataset
**Considered.** IBM AML (synthetic, readable features, labelled laundering
patterns) and Elliptic++ (wallet addresses, heterogeneous graph).
**Decision.** Elliptic only.
**Why.** The research question needs real data with real temporal drift, and only
Elliptic has a documented drift event (the dark market shutdown) and published
baselines to compare with. Synthetic data lets models learn simulator quirks. A
second dataset would roughly double the work without strengthening the main answer;
depth on one dataset (rolling retraining, calibration, drift analysis) is worth more.

## D-008: Showcase via README + Hugging Face Space, not public homelab hosting
**Decision.** The GitHub README carries the results (generated table, per-step F1
plot, findings, dashboard GIF). A Hugging Face Space serves a lightweight demo from
precomputed artefacts. The full stack (Neo4j + API + dashboard) runs locally with
`docker compose up`.
**Why.** Recruiters spend about a minute and rarely run code, so the README matters
most. A public Neo4j-backed app on a personal server adds attack surface and uptime
work for little extra visibility. To support both modes, graph access goes through
one interface with two implementations: Neo4j (full stack) and in-memory from
exported files (demo).
